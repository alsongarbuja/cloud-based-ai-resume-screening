# Day 2 Progress â€“ Project Bootstrap (kamAI)

## Date
2025-10-17

## What I Did
- Created project folder `kamAI`.
- Set up Python virtual environment `.venv` and activated it.
- Installed Django + DRF + JWT lib.
- Created Django project package `kamai`.
- Verified the dev server runs locally.

## Why It Matters
This is the base for our API. Everyone can now clone and run the same structure.

## Next Steps
- Initialize Git repo and .gitignore.
- Add a /healthz endpoint.
- Prepare Docker & Postgres.
